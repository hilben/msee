Web Service Monitoring Framework - SME
======================================

=> How do I start and use the SME?

  1. Start the run.sh script with the help of the following command (Unix/Linux):
        
        sh ./run.sh

  2. Wait until the compiling and starting process is finished. You should see
     something similar to:

        2011-05-18 18:43:53.533::INFO:  Started SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:9090
        [INFO] Started Jetty Server
        [INFO] Starting scanner at interval of 10 seconds.

  3. Open your favorite browser and visit:
        
        http://localhost:9090/wsmf-webservice/services
