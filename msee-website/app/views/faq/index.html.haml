  %h3 1. How do I can access the SESA platform?
  %p{"align" => "justify"}
    As described under
    %a{"href" => "release.html"} Release
    you can use the following SOAP endpoints to access the single components.
    %ul
      %li
        %a{"href" => "http://sesa.sti2.at:8080/registration-webservice", "target" => "_blank"} Registration Component
        %a{"href" => "http://sesa.sti2.at:8080/registration-webservice/services/register?wsdl", "target" => "_blank"} (WSDL)
      %li
        %a{"href" => "http://sesa.sti2.at:8080/discovery-webservice", "target" => "_blank"} Discovery Component
        %a{"href" => "http://sesa.sti2.at:8080/discovery-webservice/services/discovery?wsdl", "target" => "_blank"} (WSDL)
      %li
        %a{"href" => "http://sesa.sti2.at:8080/invoker-webservice", "target" => "_blank"} Invocation Component (Invoker)
        %a{"href" => "http://sesa.sti2.at:8080/invoker-webservice/services/invoker?wsdl", "target" => "_blank"} (WSDL)
    To access SOAP services you can use your favorite development environment or for a first testing
    the graphical tool
    %a{"href" => "http://www.soapui.org/", "target" => "_blank"} SoapUI.

  %h3 2. Is it possible to register my (auto-generated) WSDL services?
  %p{"align" => "justify"}
    If the <u>W</u>eb <u>S</u>ervice <u>D</u>escription <u>L</u>anguage (WSDL) File is annotated semantically you
    are able to use the Registration Component to register your service. Otherwise you have to annotate the WSDL
    file as described under
    %a{"href" => "/doc/service_annotation"}Service Annotation.

      You don't have to change your service in order to register it. The only thing that you must do is to
      change the WSDL file. The changed WSDL could be stored also on another host.

  %h3 3. Where do I can find more information about SESA?
  %p{"align" => "justify"}
    As SESA is part of more than one project the documentation is separated over different deliverables and
    technical documentations. A detailed description of the first version of the SESA platform you can find in
    the e-Freight
    %em Deliverable D2.4/D2.5 - e-Freight Semantic Registry and Repository / e-Freight SESA Platform (version 1)

  %h3 4. Where do I can find the SESA source code?
